### Challenge 3 - Lock it down
Dr. Doom is up to his old tricks!  He's installed a reverse shell on Farmer Joe's server AND he is stealing Farmer Joe's hard earned coins.  
Find a way to stop the flow of coins (the longer it takes the more coins you lose).

Hints:
* Dr. Doom's evil cyber lair is @ 10.0.0.241 
* It's stealing keys from your server @ 10.0.0.35 (probably want to stop your server from talking to it...)
* By any means necessary...
* Dr. Doom takes a key every 5 minutes, points are awarded for speed in preventing that
