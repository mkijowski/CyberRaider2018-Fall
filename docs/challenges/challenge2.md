### Challenge 2 - The rest of the farm
Now that you are getting familiar with Farmer Joe's local linux system, lets take a look at his coin server (IP address: 10.0.0.35).  There are flags associated with all open ports, can you find them?

This challenge involves starting off with a scan of the given IP address.  I recommend looking into some basice nmap tutorials on google before getting started ;)

###### Helpful commands
`nmap, nc, wget, ssh, telnet`
